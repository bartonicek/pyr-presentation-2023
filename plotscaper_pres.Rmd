# The Visual Brain

- About 20-30% percent of our brain is involved in visual processing (Van Essen, 2003)
- Some visual information is processed pre-attentively:
  - *Subitizing*: can accurately count 4 items in < 300 ms 
  - Other visual dimensions such as color, size, and position can also be processed pre-attentively
  - Especially true with contrast

# Interactive Data Visualization

- Many (often very different) definitions
- Based around ideas such as:
  - Users can **change** the visualization
  - Change happens at high enough **speed**
  - Users can **query** different parts of the dataset
  - Change propagates between multiple **linked** plots
  - Users can manipulate **parameters** of an underlying mathematical model

> "Rapid advances in the power, simplicity, and familiarity of visualization combined with an increasing awareness of the potential of visual communication have pushed the field to the cusp of mainstream breakthrough in society.  

> [...] Still, very few data science tools and workflows actually employ interactive visualization as anything more than a mere communication tool used to disseminate results at the end of an investigation to stakeholders and the general public."

# Could we combine exploration, ease of use, flexibility, and consistency?

---

# The Idea: Plotscaper

- Goal: an interactive data exploration system aimed at researchers and data scientists
- Mid-level framework/the *Goldilocks zone*: 
  - Low-code enough so that exploration is cost-effective
  - Flexible enough for a wide range of visualizations
  - Build interactive figures out of composable pieces ("like" `ggplot2`)
- Predictable two-way interactions, especially brushing
- Easy to set up multiplot figures with shared data & state

---

# The Fundamental Problem

- Consistent two-way interaction is not easy!
- Linked brushing: most important
- Every graphical object represents a statistical summary on a partition of the data (`geoms` and `stats` in `ggplot2`)

> *What if some kinds of statistical summaries "work" and others don't?*

# Monoids: Definition

- A Monoid $(X, e, \otimes)$ is a tuple that consists of:
  - An ordered set $X$ (e.g. $\mathbb{R}^+$)
  - A "neutral" element $e \in X$
  - A binary function $\otimes : X \times X \to X$  
  
  
- Such that:
  - $x \otimes e = e \otimes x = x$, for all $x \in X$ (unitality)
  - $(x \otimes y) \otimes z = x \otimes (y \otimes z)$, for all $x, y, z \in X$ (associativity)

---

# *In English: "A whole that's just the 'sum' of its parts"*

---

# Monoids Examples 1

- Sums: $(\mathbb{R}^+, \leq, 0, +)$
  - $x + 0 = x$
  - $(x + y) + z = x + (y + z)$  
  
  
- Products: $(\mathbb{R}, \leq, 1, \times)$
  - $x \cdot 1 = x$
  - $(x \cdot y) \cdot z = x \cdot (y \cdot z)$  
  
  
- Counts: $(\mathbb{N}, \leq, 0, + 1)$
- Sums of vectors: $(\mathbf{Vec_2}, | \cdot |, (0, 0), +)$
- Matrix products $(\mathbf{Matrix}, \mathbf{Det}, \mathbf{I}, \cdot)$

---

# Monoids: Examples 2

- But there's nothing in the definition of a Monoid that says that numeric quantities need to be involved:

```{r}

paste("", "hello")

paste(paste("hello", "world"), "bye") 

paste("hello", paste("world", "bye"))

```


---

# Monoids: Extra Properties

- We can also impose some additional properties: 


- $x \otimes y = y \otimes x$, for all $x, y \in X$ (symmetry)
- If $x_1 \leq x_2$ and $y_1 \leq y_2$, then $x_1 \otimes y_1 \leq x_2 \otimes y_2$, for all $x_1, x_2, y_1, y_2 \in X$ (monotonicity)


- I.e. *"the direction of combining things does not matter"* & *"accumulation happens in one direction"* (where might that be relevant?)

---

# Monoids: Counterexamples

- Exponentiation: $x^{({y^z})} \neq (x^y)^z$
- Means, variances
- Products on $\mathbb{R}$ are monoids but not monotonic: <br> $(-2) \leq 1$ but $(-2) \cdot (-2) \not \leq 1 \cdot 1$ 
- (products on $\mathbb{R}^+$ are monotonic though)
- Matrix products are not symmetric: $AB \neq BA$

# The Plotscaper Model

1. Graphical objects represent (nested) partitions of the data
2. A set of statistical summaries is applied to the partitions
3. The summaries apply across all levels of partitioning
  + .small[*(E.g. sum of x across the entire dataset, sum of x within a bar, sum of x within a group within a bar)*] 
  
4. Change of parameters propagates reactively, from parent partitions to child partitions
  + .small[*(E.g. in a histogram, brushing does not affect the binwidth, however, changing binwidth does affect the brushed counts)*]

# Implementation: Prototype

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("bartonicek/plotscaper")
```

- 5 wrapper plot types: 
  - scatterplot, barplot, histogram, bubbleplot, squareplot
- Supported interactivity: 
  - transient/persistent selection
  - panning, changing size and alpha
- Just a JS file: Runs in RStudio viewer, RMarkdown,...
- CSS grid layout for interesting figures

---

# Implementation: New Version

- A more general version is currently in the works
- Same basic features as the prototype + extra
- Idea: 2 main composable pieces:
  - Wrangler(s): partition and summarize the data 
  - Representation(s): encode summaries into objects
- Written using Typescript, Solid JS for reactivity, no other external libraries/packages
